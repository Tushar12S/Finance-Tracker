# Finance-Tracker

This is a simple finance tracker application built with React. It allows users to track their financial transactions, view their balance, and analyze expenses.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or use `npm`)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It optimizes the React app for the best performance.

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Warning:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all configuration files and dependencies into your project so you can fully customize them.
